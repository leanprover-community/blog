In July 2022 there were 611 PRs merged into mathlib. We list some of the highlights below.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

* Arithmetic
     - [PR #15091](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15091) defines Bézout rings and [PR #15424](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15424) proves that Bezout domains are integrally closed. [PR #15109](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15109) proves the same for GCD domains.
     - [PR #14717](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14717) proves Wilson's Theorem.
     - [PR #15315](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15315) proves $[Frac(S):Frac(R)] = [S/pS:R/p]$for a Dedekind domain $R$ and its integral closure $S$ and maximal ideal $p$. This is the first step in showing the fundamental identity of inertia degree and ramification index.
     - [PR #8002](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8002) proves Bertrand's postulate.

* Algebraic geometry and commutative algebra

     - [PR #15487](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15487) proves the affine communication lemma.
     - [PR #14944](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14944) introduces a basic framework for classes of morphisms between schemes.
    Examples are provided by
    [PR #15379](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15379) (finite type is a local property),
    [PR #15427](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15427) (finite ring morphisms are stable under base change), and
    [PR #15243](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15243) (formally étale/smooth/unramified morphisms are stable under base change).
     - [PR #15089](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15089) defines the Rees algebra of an ideal.
     - [PR #12895](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12895) adds injective modules and Baer's criterion.

* Group theory
     - [PR #8632](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8632) proves that groups of order $p^2$ are commutative.
     - [PR #15402](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15402) proves that a finitely generated torsion abelian group is finite.

* Non-commutative or non-associative algebra
     - [PR #14348](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14348) defines the Ore localization of a ring (a non-commutative analogue of the usual localization).
     - [PR #14790](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14790) gives the universal property and isomorphisms for the even subalgebra of a Clifford algebra.
     - [PR #14179](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14179) characterises Cartan subalgebras as limiting values of upper central series.
     - [PR #11073](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11073) introduces Jordan rings.

* Topology and functional analysis
     - [PR #14965](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14965) introduces Noetherian spaces.
     - [PR #15124](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15124) proves that in a normed space, a set is von Neumann bounded if and only if it is bounded in the metric sense.
     - [PR #15055](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15055) proves the Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem: if a symmetric operator is defined everywhere, then it is automatically continuous.

* Probability and measure theory
     - [PR #14737](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14737) proves Doob's maximal inequality for non-negative submartingales.
     - [PR #14909](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14909) proves the discrete stochastic integral of a submartingale is a submartingale.
     - [PR #15106](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15106) computes gaussian integrals.
     - [PR #15129](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15129) establishes Chernoff's bound on the upper/lower tail of a real random variable.

* Combinatorics
     - In additive combinatorics, [PR #14697](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14697) proves Ruzsa's covering lemma: for finite sets $s$ and $t$ in a commutative group, we can cover $s$ with at most $|s + t|/ |t|$ copies of $t - t$. [PR #14070](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14070) introduces Behrend's construction and [PR #15327](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15327) establish Behrend's lower bound on Roth numbers.
     - In combinatorics of families of finite sets, [PR #14497](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14497) proves the Harris-Kleitman inequality and [PR #14543](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14543) proves Kleitman's bound.
     - In graph theory, [PR #15158](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15158) proves Euler's condition for trails.

* Computability theory and information theory
     - [PR #14739](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14739) introduces the Hamming distance and norm.

* Tactics
     - [PR #14878](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14878) brings `polyrith`, a tactic using Sage to solve polynomial equalities with hypotheses.
