In October and November 2022 there were 512 and 453 PRs merged into mathlib. We list some of the highlights below.

During these two months, we got two new versions of Lean. We also started to systematically port mathlib to Lean4, see the [wiki](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki).
