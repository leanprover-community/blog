This post summarizes some of the activity that happened in mathlib in November.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

* Geometry and algebraic topology.
    - The series 
      [PR #10284](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10284),
      [PR #10297](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10297),
      [PR #10303](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10303),
      [PR #10328](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10328),
      [PR #10334](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10334),
      and [PR #10401](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10401)
      constructs the sheafification of presheaves with respect to
      a Grothendieck topology on a category, culminating with a construction
      of colimits in the category `SheafedSpace`. It is an important building block in
      setting up algebraic geometry, as well as a requirement for the
      [Liquid Tensor Experiment](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid) 
      (LTE). A corollary is that the category of
      sheaves with values in a suitable concrete abelian category is itself
      an abelian category. This has been formalised for LTE, and should
      appear in mathlib in the near future.
    - Barycentric coordinates have been further studied in a series of PRs including for instance
      [PR #10320](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10320) relating them to determinants.      
    - [PR #10381](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10381)
      proves the orthogonal group is generated by reflections.
    - [PR #10195](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10195)
      defines the fundamental groupoid, as functor from `Top` to
      `Groupoid`.

* Number theory.
    - [PR #9071](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9071) defines the class number of number fields and function fields.
  This finishes the finiteness proof of the class group of a number field and function field,
  described in [a previous blog post](https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/dedekind-domains-and-class-number-in-lean/).
    - [PR #8820](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8820) adds  Lucas primality test.

* Group theory.
    - [PR #10059](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10059) proves that (infinite) Sylow subgroups are isomorphic.
    - [PR #10283](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10283) proves the full Schur-Zassenhaus theorem.
    - [PR #10249](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10249) defines the exponent of a group.

* Combinatorics.
    - [PR #10029](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10029) proves
     Hindman's theorem on finite sums.
    - Set families are making their way to mathlib with
      [PR #9926](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9926),
      [PR #10223](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10223),
      [PR #10238](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10238)
      respectively defining antichains, shadow of a set family, UV compression.
      Those are ingredients for
      the [LYM inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubell%E2%80%93Yamamoto%E2%80%93Meshalkin_inequality),
      [Sperner's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperner%27s_theorem)
      and the [Kruskal-Katona theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperner%27s_theorem).

* Linear algebra and functional analysis
    - The sequence of PRs 
      [PR #9840](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9840),
      [PR #9995](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9995),
      [PR #10317](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10317)
      establishes the connection between eigenvalues and the Rayleigh quotient,
      and proves the diagonalization theorem for self-adjoint endomorphisms on finite-dimensional inner product spaces.
    - [PR #10145](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10145) introduces $C^*$-algebras.
    - [PR #10530](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10530) proves properties of spectrum in a Banach algebra.
    - [PR #9097](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9097) defines the Minkowski gauge functional.

* Analysis
    - [PR #9791](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9791)
      proves the Picard-Lindelöf/Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem about ordinary differential equations.
    - [PR #10057](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10057) defines Vitali families
      and [PR #10101](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10101) 
      shows the main theorem on differentiation of measures:
      given two measures `ρ` and `μ` on a finite-dimensional real vector space,
      the ratio `ρ (ball x r) / μ (ball x r)` converges `μ`-almost everywhere
      to the Radon-Nikodym derivative of `ρ` with respect to `μ` when `r` tends to `0`.
      The theorem is in fact proved in the more general context of Vitali families, as in Federer's famous book on geometric measure theory.
    - [PR #10073](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10073) proves convergence of a sequence which does not oscillate infinitely.
    - [PR #10258](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10258) proves that, if $u_n$ is subadditive, then $u_n / n$ converges.
