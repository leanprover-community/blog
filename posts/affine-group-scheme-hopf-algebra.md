title: The correspondence between affine group schemes and Hopf algebras
type: text
---

This February saw the birth of the [Toric](https://github.com/YaelDillies/Toric) project,
whose aim is to build the theory of toric varieties
following the famous textbook by Cox, Little and Schenck.

An early discovery of the project was that "toric variety" contains "torus"
and that Mathlib didn't (contain a torus).

This blog post is an announcement that this unexpected prerequisite was recently cleared.
It explains what tori and toric varieties are and what exactly we needed to know about them.

A companion article describes the technical difficulties we encountered in more depth.
