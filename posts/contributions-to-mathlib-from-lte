title: Contributions to mathlib from LTE
type: text
---
When the [Liquid Tensor Experiment](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/) started,
in December 2020, mathlib already
[had](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/c5009dd7140cf6ae53bf4ddeb57992eb10053b0b/src/analysis/normed_space)
a decent theory of normed spaces. With this post I want to show how mathlib can benefit
from projects like [LTE](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/), showing what we added
to the theory of normed spaces in almost one year of work.

Besides several small missing lemmas, we added the following notions.
* `normed_group_hom`: we already had the operator norm, but no bundled hom between normed
  groups. We introduced `normed_group_hom G H`, that it is itself a normed group. We also
  introduced kernels and images of a normed groups hom.
* `semi_normed_group`: a seminorm generlizes a norm by allowing nonzero vectors of zero
  (semi)norm. This notion is needed in [LTE](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/),
  and we introduced it in mathlib (providing a reasonable API). Since `normed_group` depends on
  `metric_space` that in turn depends on `emetric_space`, we had first of all to introduce
  (extended) pseudo metric spaces. We also introduced `semi_normed_space` and similar related notions.
* `normed_group_quotient`: the theory of quotients of (semi) normed groups was completely
  missing. We now have a good API for it.
* `normed_group_hom.completion`: similarly to `normed_group_quotient`, we add to develop
  the theory of completion of normed groups and normed groups homs from scratch.
* `nnnorm`: sometimes it is useful to consider the norm as taking values in the nonnegative
  reals. We introduced the class `has_nnnorm`, with the obvious instances, and wrote an API for it.
* `SemiNormedGroup`: we introduced `SemiNormedGroup`, the category of semi normed groups,
  as a preadditive category with kernels and cokernels. We promoted `normed_group_hom.completion`
  to a functor, showing its universal property.
