# My Experiences at the Machine-Checked Mathematics workshop
Hello, everyone! My name is Jana Göken, a math master's student from Bremen. Today, I want to share with you my experiences at the Machine-Checked Mathematics workshop that introduced me to the world of proof assistants, specifically Lean. The workshop took place in Leiden from the 10th to the 14th of July 2023, and it was an amazing and educational journey.

# My First Encounter with Lean
The first time I heard about the proof assistant Lean, or any proof assistant, was in the summer of 2022 when I attended the International Congress of Mathematicians for Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry in Zürich. There, I took the opportunity to attend a fascinating talk by Kevin Buzzard about the proof assistant Lean. I was instantly intrigued because, with the current rise of AI, I saw the great potential in the idea of using Lean to aid in mathematical proofs. Despite the excitement, I wasn't sure whether I would be able to start my own journey with Lean by myself.

Fast forward to May 2023, and I received an email from "Women in Number Theory" about an upcoming workshop in Leiden focused on learning the Lean proof assistant. This was the perfect opportunity for me! Excited about the prospect of learning Lean, I immediately signed up.

# Diving into Lean
The workshop spanned five days, from July 10th to July 14th, at the Lorentz Center in Leiden. The participants received detailed instructions to download Lean and the mathlib library a few days before the workshop. Previous worries whether I, as a complete beginner in Lean, could follow the workshop, were quickly put to rest by reassuring emails, a really supportive environment, and kind experts who were answering every question. For those of us who faced challenges during the installation process, there was a timeslot during the first day to fix any problems and ensure that everyone was ready to begin.

Each day of the workshop was filled with a variety of activities, including talks, guided tutorials, exercise sessions, and group projects with at least one Lean expert per group. It was incredible to witness our progress throughout the week. On the first day, we struggled with seemingly simple proofs, like associativity of addition. But by the last day, everyone was presenting their unique contributions to the mathlib library, something I never thought possible at the beginning.

One of the most valuable takeaways from the workshop was learning about the Zulip platform, where the Lean community actively communicates. Even after the workshop concluded, we could easily connect with the experts, ask questions, and seek guidance as we continued our projects.

# Inclusive Community
For me, the best aspect of this workshop was definitely the welcoming environment. I got to know really kind and amazing people. As a woman in the field of mathematics, I felt incredibly welcomed, and I got the impression that everyone felt very welcomed, regardless of gender, sexuality, or appearance. Consequently, we were a colorful bunch of people with diverse styles and backgrounds, and I really enjoyed the variety.

# Exciting Future for Mathematics
In conclusion, my experience at the Lean workshop in Leiden was amazing. I met wonderful people, explored new mathematical territories, and gained valuable skills that will undoubtedly shape the future of my mathematical journey. I wholeheartedly recommend anyone interested in proof assistants, particularly Lean, to attend such workshops. The education and sense of community you will discover are truly remarkable.

I am very grateful for this amazing opportunity, and I hope to see everyone again soon, collaborating and making significant contributions to mathematics using Lean. With proof assistants like Lean paving the way, I am confident that artificial intelligence will play a vital role in the future of mathematics.

If you're curious about the capability of Lean, don't hesitate to dive in and discover the power of proof assistants for yourself.
