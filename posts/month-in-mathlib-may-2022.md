In May 2022 there were 606 PRs merged into mathlib. We list some of the highlights below.

* Model theory
     * [PR #13980](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13980) proves that any theory with infinite models has arbitrarily large models
     * [PR #13723](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13723) and [PR #13982](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13982) proves the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem

* Category theory and homological algebra
     * [PR #13882](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13882) proves that simple objects are indecomposable
     * [PR #13707](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13707) proves that a left rigid category is monoidal closed and that functors from a groupoid to a rigid category is again a rigid category.
     * Homology is still making progress, both in concrete setups such as [PR #12622](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12622) which develops the API for complexes of modules, and in abelian categories with [PR #14009](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14009) bringing short exact sequences from the Liquid Tensor Experiment.
     * In algebraic topology, [PR #14304](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14304) defines the nerve of a category as a simplicial set. 

* Algebra
     * [PR #13414](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13414) starts the study of torsion ideals. This is a step towards the long awaited classification of finite type modules over principal ideal domains, stay tuned!
     * [PR #13784](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13784) starts the formalization of Laurent Polynomials. Many more PRs followed or are on their way.
     * The work to remove unneeded commutativity assumptions continued, in particular in [PR #13966](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13966) and [PR #13865](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13865).
     * Matrices also got some work both on the alebraic side with [PR #13845](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13845) priving that invertible matrices over a ring with invariant basis number are square, and the analytical side with [PR #13520](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13520) defininf the matrix exponential. In order to make this easier to work with, mathlib now has two different normed algebra structures on matrices, the $L^\infty$ operator norm in [PR #13518](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13518) and the frobenius norm in [PR #13497](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13497).
     * In representation theory, [PR #13685](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13685) proves the category of `Rep k G` of representations of a group `G` on `k`-vector spaces is symmetric monoidal, and [PR #13782](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13782) proves it is linear. [PR #13740](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13740) introduces the category of finite dimensional such representation.
