from blockchain entrepreneur Charles C. Hoskinson will be used to establish the Hoskinson
Center for Formal Mathematics, housed in the Department of Philosophy.
You can read the &lt;a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2021/september/hoskinson-center-for-formal-mathematics.html"&gt;university press release&lt;/a&gt; and
watch Hoskinson's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3snIzhjqsk0&amp;amp;ab_channel=CharlesHoskinson"&gt;YouTube announcement&lt;/a&gt;. You can also watch
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCLJOrJFLZQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=IOHK"&gt;Hoskinson's presentation&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbz6cdnFyPc&amp;amp;ab_channel=IOHK"&gt;my presentation&lt;/a&gt; at an
inauguration ceremony that was held at Carnegie Mellon the day before.
The slides I used for the presentation are &lt;a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Talks/hoskinson_inaugural.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center's mission is to support the work being done by the Lean community,
to promote the use of Lean and its libraries,
and to seek out ways of using the technology to make mathematics accessible and enjoyable to
as wide an audience as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial endowment will be used to support postdoctoral researchers and graduate students,
as well as occasional meetings and visitors.
In the near future, the center will focus on supporting the port of mathlib to Lean 4,
developing automation and the user interface, and, perhaps most importantly,
preparing textbooks and educational materials based on Lean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/hoskinson-center-announced/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 21:39:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Welcome to the Lean community blog!</title><link>https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/welcome-to-the-lean-community-blog/</link><dc:creator>The Lean prover community</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is our brand new blog where you'll be able to find news about what is
happening in the Lean prover community. It will feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posts highlighting some new contributions to mathlib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;news about ongoing projects such as the Liquid tensor experiment or the sphere eversion project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;news about exciting developments in other proofs assistants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;announcements of conferences and talks &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some explanations of specific topics in a less formal context than the documentations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speculations about future developments or somewhat philosophical discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no predefined list of authors. Everybody can submit a pull-request
with a post. If you are unsure whether your post will be welcome then don't
hesitate to first discuss the topic of your post on Zulip before investing too
much time writing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/welcome-to-the-lean-community-blog/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 19:36:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
