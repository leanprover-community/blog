However, as we were working on adding the basics of functional analysis to mathlib, a drawback quickly became apparent: conjugate-linear maps could not directly be expressed as linear maps. This meant that some constructions could not be formulated in their most natural way: for example, the map that takes an operator to its adjoint on a complex Hilbert space is a conjugate linear map, and so is the Riesz representation that maps a vector to its dual. This was also preventing us from developing the orthogonal group, the unitary group, etc, properly.&lt;/p&gt;
